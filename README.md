### Classical Models for Environmental Sound Classification (ESC)

**Description**:<br>This branch serves as a repository for all the classical deep learning models we have implemented from various existing research papers. Its purpose is to enable easy access and comparison of these models with the one we have proposed.

**Dataset Used**:<br> [ESC - 10](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-10/tree/553c8f1743b9dba6b282e1323c3ca8fa76923448)

**Dataset Description**:<br> ESC-10 consists of 400 environmental recordings categorized into 10 different classes. Each class comprises 40 audio clips (44.1 KHz, Mono), with each clip of duration 5 seconds.
